            <h1>What is Markdown ?</h1>
            <p>
                Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext
                text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004,
                Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.<br /><br />

                Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. <br />
                In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases,
                and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. <br />
                When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to
                indicate which words and phrases should look different.<br /><br />

                For instance, to denote a heading,
                you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). <br />
                Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**).
                It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text,
                especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. <br />
                The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Atom text editor.<br />

        <div class="row">
            <p>
                You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application.<br />
                Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux,
                iOS, and Android operating systems. <br />
                There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown. <br />
                <br />

                Depending on the application you use,
                you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. <br />
                But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive,
                so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.<br />

            <p>
                The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible.
                The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text,
                without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

            <h2>How does it work ?</h2>
            <p>
                Dillinger makes writing in Markdown easy because it hides the stuff happening behind the scenes, <br />
                but it’s worth exploring how the process works in general.

                When you write in Markdown,
                the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. <br />
                But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?<br />
                <br />

                The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file.<br />
                There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications
                that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences,
                all of the applications do the same thing. <br />
                Like Dillinger,
                they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers.<br /><br />

                Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor
                (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”)
                to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. <br />
                At that point,
                your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. <br />
                You can see a visual representation of this process below. <br />

            To summarize, this is a four-part process:<br />
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application.
                    The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
                </li>
                <li>
                    View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application
                    to convert it to another file format, like PDF.
                </li>
